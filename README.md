## 🛩️ AeroMind — Intelligent Drone Mission Planner

AeroMind is a lightweight, integrated mission-planning platform designed to make drone operations safer, faster, and more efficient. Built during the EUDIS Hackathon, it brings together real-time data, AI-based risk prediction, and optimized routing into a single, intuitive interface. In disaster scenarios or military operations, conditions change rapidly, like weather, terrain, visibility, signal reliability, and regulations can turn a mission into failure. Up to 60% of missions face delays due to lack of real-time data, while only 30% of operators use dynamic planning tools. Real-time decisions could cut delays by half. AeroMind fills exactly this gap.
